# Chat Bot

- This is a chatbot app developed in Angular 15
- To run the application, we can do it locally or by using stackbliz
- To run it on stackbliz, which is the fastest way, you can use the link (https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/johnenosh92/chatbot_new_app)
- Once you navigate to the link it will either run the application by running "npm install & npm start" commands or we have to run the commands manually.
- After the commands run successfully,  the output is shown in the right side, if not seen plese click the Open Preview button to the top right corner which has an arrow icon
-  To run the application locally, download the code locally, install node in your machine and run these two commands "npm install & npm start" which will then run the application in localhose:4200
